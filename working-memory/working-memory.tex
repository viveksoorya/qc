\subsection{More Notes}

    \begin{enumerate}
    
    
    \item A coordinate transformation is a linear operation.
    \item That a matrix can be composed of output bases is a property of input bases $e_i$, and that the requires input bases $e_i$ and the transformation to be into the same vector space.
    
    
    
    \item In matrix multiplication, the number of columns out of the left matrix and the number of rows in the right matrix have to be equal.
    \item Also, the number of rows of the left matrix gives the number of rows of the resultant matrix.
    \item The number of columns of the right matrix gives the number of columns of the resultant matrix.

    
    \item 'unitary transformation' of a "state vector" can be physically interpreted as the 'time evolution' of "an isolated quantum mechanical system":
    \item Unitary transformation
    \begin{enumerate} % This allows for sub-items with letters
        \item Reversible transformation
        \item inverse is adjoint
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Reversible operations are the only operations we concern ourselves with so far as quantum computation and quantum information is concerned
    \item unitary operations are the only operations possible for evolution.
    \item We will deal with only finite-dimensional Hilbert space.
    \item projection of a vector on another vector can be obtained by an inner product. 
    \item linear means matrix (scalar (vector)) = scalar (matrix (vector))
    \item inner product needs linearity 
    \end{enumerate}


    \subsection{unitary operator}
    \begin{enumerate}    
    \item Unitary transformation depends only on initial and final state.
    \item why does it not depend on the intermediary at time stamps or states? How do we know that it doesn't? Is it odd that it doesn't?

    \item Does the unitary operator depend on the initial timestamp or does it depend on the initial state vector and the final state vector?
    
    \item How to find all unitary operators of a given dimension.
    \end{enumerate}
